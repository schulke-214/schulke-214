I am a software developer and enthousiast, currently living in berlin, germany together with my awesome girlfriend and two (even more awesome) cats. Right now i am working at moccu (a berlin based digital design agency) as frontend developer and studying media computer science at th brandenburg in the spare time.

The _black boxes_ of computer science are fascinating me - i like to research and hack on things which are a bit more unusual than todo apps (compiler, window manager, emulators..). Everything that has to do with hardware, language design, math & operating systems is just blowing my mind.
